Big news from QMEL today. Julia Saltzman has successfully defended her MS thesis! She delivered a terrific public lecture with folks attending both in person and online. Her work focused on marine predator trends at Cocos Island, Costa Rica. She has already submitted one of her chapters for publication with another manuscript in the works.

Julia will be missed in the lab. She is moving onto bigger and better things as she will start a PhD. She will work with [Dr. Mariana Fuentes](https://marineturtleresearch.com/) at Florida State University.
