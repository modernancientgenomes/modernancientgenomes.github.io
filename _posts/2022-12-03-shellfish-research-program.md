QMEL is embarking on a new local research program. We received a [grant](https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-agricultural-experiment-station/research#collapse_13879) from the New Hampshire Agricultural Experimental Station to explore how extreme events affect shellfish, especially oysters and New Hampshire. The project involves our collaborators in the  [Jellison Lab](https://brittanyjellison.wixsite.com/research), local New Hampshire shellfish farmers, and The Nature Conservancy. 

This project will be a core part of the lab over the next several years. The project will involve data analysis, mathematical modeling, field work, and lab experiments. We are currently building the biosensors, collecting preliminary data, and preparing for a field season in 2023.
