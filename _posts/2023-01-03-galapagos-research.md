This past January, Easton White headed south to the Galapagos Islands for his second trip to the archipelago. Easton received a Charles Darwin Sustainability Fellowship to conduct research in the region. He is working with [local scientists](https://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/) to study industrial fishing in and around the islands. The work builds on prior work by Easton and a previous QMEL lab member, [Julia Saltzman](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/julia-saltzman.html), on the dynamics of marine predator populations in the region.
