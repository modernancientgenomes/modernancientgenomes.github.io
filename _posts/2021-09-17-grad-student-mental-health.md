Members of QMEL recently attended a workshop on graduate student mental health. This is a topic we take very seriously as a lab group. The workshop was attended by graduate students, staff, and faculty. We discussed ongoing and potential new opportunities to continue working on mental health in academia in general. Here are a few resources and readings:
