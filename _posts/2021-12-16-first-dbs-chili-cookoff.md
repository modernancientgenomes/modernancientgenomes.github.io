With the semester winding down, a few members of the department organized the inaugural [DBS](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences) Chili-cookoff. Graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff joined in on the fun. It was a great time to reconnect as a department after a busy fall semester.

We had eight contestants for the best chili. Our own [Sophie Wulfing](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/sophie-wulfing.html) actually won for best chili.

Over the course of the Fall semester, graduate students took turns presenting their work during weekly seminars. At the chili cookoff, votes were tallied and our own [Julia Saltzman](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/julia-saltzman.html) won for best student talk! It is a huge accomplishment, especially as she is only in her first semester of graduate school.
