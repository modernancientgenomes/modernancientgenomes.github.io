We have a new paper out today on trends for US marine mammal populations. 

Easton R. White, Zachary Schakner, Amber Bellamy, and Mridula Srinivasan Detecting population trends for US marine mammals. [Conservation Science and Practice](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.611)

A few key takeaways:

- Despite their importance, we found that only 20\% (n = 49) of marine mammal stocks had some form of trend analysis to study changes over time
- We found that of marine mammal stocks with trend analysis, 61\% were increasing, 12\% of stocks were decreasing, and 27\% percent were defined as stable. This is good news! But we still need to assess more stocks
- We also used various time series techniques to show that seven sampling events over more than 10 years were needed for a high statistical power. This is very different than previous estimates for marine mammals
