I am thrilled to announce Julia Saltzman has joined the lab as a graduate student! [Julia](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/julia-saltzman.html) graduated from the University of Miami in 2021 with her bachelorâ€™s in marine science, biology, and ecosystem science and policy. Her research at UNH will focus on socio-ecological questions in small-scale tropical fisheries and species monitoring.

Welcome Julia!
