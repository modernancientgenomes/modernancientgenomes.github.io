QMEL's first New Hampshire field season is officially underway! We have four undergraduate interns in the lab this summer. [Melanie Carolan](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/melanie-carolan.html) (Vassar College) and [Harris Krasner](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/harris-krasner.html) (University of New Hampshire) worked with QMEL graduate students [Ana Silverio](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/ana-silverio.html) and [Julia Saltzman](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/julia-saltzman.html) to build BRUVs, or Baited Remote Underwater Video cameras. The small PVC contraptions house a GoPro camera, temperature and light sensors, and a mesh bag for bait. Melanie is spending the summer deploying these cameras at [Shoals Marine Lab](https://www.shoalsmarinelaboratory.org/) on Appledore Island, which is about seven miles from mainland Maine. Harris will be using the same methods but will focus on Great Bay Estuary and coastal New Hampshire. Combined, these data will provide valuable information on fish and invertebrate trends in the region.

The lab will also host Katherine Pag√°n Rivera from the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao. Katherine will be using audio from hydrophones stationed along the New Hampshire coast to estimate biodiversity from sound alone.

Lastly, Ahilya Kadba, a University of New Hampshire undergraduate, will be working with QMEL's [Sophie Wulfing](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/members/sophie-wulfing.html). Ahilya will be helping Sophie on her project focused on Madagascar octopus fisheries.
