# Hackathon

The third hackathon centered around documentation, for which we use, among other tools, [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki).
DokuWiki is purely text-file based and doesn't require a database. 
It's syntax is straighforward which makes it a versatile tool to programmers and non-programmers alike.
