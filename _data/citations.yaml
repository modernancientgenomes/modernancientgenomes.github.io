  title: The genetic origins of Saint Helena’s liberated Africans
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
  abstract: Between the early 16th and late 19th centuries, an estimated 12 million
    Africans were transported to the Americas as part of the transatlantic slave trade.
    Following Britain’s abolition of slave trade in 1807, the Royal Navy patrolled
    the Atlantic and intercepted slave ships that continued to operate. During this
    period, the island of St Helena in the middle of the South Atlantic served as
    a depot for “liberated” Africans. Between 1840 and 1867, approximately 27,000
    Africans were disembarked on the island. To investigate their origins, we generated
    genome-wide ancient DNA data for 20 individuals recovered from St Helena. The
    genetic data indicate that they came from West Central Africa, possibly the area
    of present-day Gabon and Angola. The data further suggest that they did not belong
    to a single population, confirming historical reports of cultural heterogeneity
    among the island’s African community. Our results shed new light on the origins
    of enslaved Africans during the final stages of the slave trade and illustrate
    how genetic data can be used to complement and validate existing historical sources.
