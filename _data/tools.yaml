  description: mlplasmids consists of binary classifiers to predict contigs either as plasmid-derived or chromosome-derived. It currently classifies short-read contigs as chromosomes and plasmids for *Enterococcus faecium*, *Enterococcus faecalis*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and *Acinetobacter baumannii*.
