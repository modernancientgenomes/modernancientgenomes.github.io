  link: https://github.com/grenaud/dice
  description: DICE is a Bayesian method to jointly estimate error rates, demographic parameters and the rate of contamination from present-day humans in ancient DNA (aDNA) samples from modern or archaic humans. Our approach is based on an MCMC sampler, and is applicable to nuclear autosomal aDNA data. It can also serve to infer the most probable ancestry of the individual(s) that contaminated the sample.
