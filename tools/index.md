# <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>Tools & Education

Welcome to the ‘Tools and Education’ section!

At the Modern and Ancient Genomes Group, we develop software tools for ancient DNA, environmental DNA, sedimentary DNA, low-coverage data, NGS data and allele frequencies. Our tools are fully open-source and free to use. 

Are you interested in improving your bioinformatics or population genetics skills? Then scroll down to the Education section, you will find courses at the Technical University of Denmark to do just that!
