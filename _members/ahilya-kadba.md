I am an international student from India and a sophomore at the University of New Hampshire where Iâ€™m majoring in Biology. As of now, I am focused on exploring research opportunities in varied fields of study within Biology and gaining transferable lab skills. In addition to working for the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab, I am an intern in a molecular biology lab at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) that studies the protein, Api5. My interests outside of academia include music and playing sports like basketball and badminton.
