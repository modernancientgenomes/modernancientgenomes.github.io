Isabel graduated from the University of New Hampshire studying statistics and analytics. She is now pursuing a graduate degree in applied math at the University of Colorado - Boulder. In the lab, Isabel completed her senior thesis. She worked with Professor White as well as her mathematics advisor to study how COVID-19 impacted the seafood industry and how it compared with other food industries. Using her data cleaning and analysis skills, such as Python, R, and JMP, she used seafood foot traffic data to address these questions.
