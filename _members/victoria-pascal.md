I'm a Postoctoral researcher in the BioIT group.

I develop tools and analyse different types of omics data. I am interested on studying the role of microbes in humans health and disease. Specifically my main project focuses on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium outbreaks that happen in Dutch hospitals. For that I'm building a pipeline to understand dissemination modes of the vancomycin-resistant genes and get insights into their transmission networks.
