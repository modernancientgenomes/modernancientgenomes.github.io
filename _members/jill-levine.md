Jill Levine is finishing her junior year at the University of Vermont where she studies both forestry and biology. After college, she plans on continuing her education. She is considering a career in medicine or natural resources, but hopes that she can combine the two. She chose her biology major because of her interest in medicine and marine biology, both stemming from separate courses in high school. Her forestry background, however, began her sophomore year at UVM when she decided she wanted to expand her knowledge on the environment and its’ impacts. 

In her free time, Jill enjoys getting outside, baking, and spending quality time with her friends. She has been skiing and hiking since she was five, allowing her to form a close relationship with nature early on.

Jill was originally intrigued by Easton’s research when she found out she could study a topic that broadly combines her two interests. She is currently studying how the coronavirus pandemic has influenced the seafood industry, focusing on the health and financial impacts of fishermen. This research has helped Jill learn new and current information about medicine and the environment while also allowing her to learn new skills, such as R and R studio. The research done has helped Jill have a clearer vision about her future path and solidified her plans to further her education.
