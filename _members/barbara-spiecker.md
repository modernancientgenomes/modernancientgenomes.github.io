**Research Interests**
<br>
Barbara Spiecker (she/her/hers) is a marine community ecologist who is broadly interested in scale-dependent responses of marine communities across space and time. 
<br>
Her research focuses on:
1. Identifying underlying mechanisms that produce complex multi-scale responses of benthic communities and how these mechanisms and 
responses affect ecosystem-level processes from the bottom up.
2. Using data from long-term monitoring programs to address pressing ecological issues, identify biological patterns across ecosystems, and provide practical solutions to common data-related issues surrounding these programs.
<br>
Alongside her research, she is actively involved with science communication and community outreach. She co-founded a non-profit organization called 
[Atomic Hands](www.atomichands.com). The organizationâ€™s mission is to foster curiosity in STEM through American Sign Language-centric resources, 
empower the signing community to develop and deliver engaging STEM topics, and encourage networking among deaf STEMists.
