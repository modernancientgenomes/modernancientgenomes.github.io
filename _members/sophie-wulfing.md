Sophie Wulfing (she/her/hers) is a quantitative and computational biologist. Prior to starting her master's at UNH, she graduated with a Bachelor's in Organismal Biology and Ecology with a minor in mathematical biology from Colorado College. Sophie has worked for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) quantifying fisheries and updating rockfish stock models. Most recently, Sophie lived in Houma, Louisiana working for Louisiana Univeristies Marine Consortium. While in Louisiana, Sophie worked on a collborative project examining coastal methane fluxes to assess their significance in relationship to climate change. Most of Sophie's interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, modeling, and ecology. Sophie employs computational tools for her research, including R and Python. Sophie's research uses a variety of data including open-access long term monitoring datasets from various fisheries stakeholders. Being from the Pacific Northwest, Sophie enjoys hiking, skiing, and exploring the new New England scenery. This semester, Sophie is a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Biology: Evolution, Biodiversity and Ecology.
