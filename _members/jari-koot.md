Hey there! I'm Jari, a 20 year old Life Science student. With a passion for programming and biology. This year I'm doing my internship at the UMC Utrecht. 
Currently I'm working on a metagenomics pipeline that creates a visualization of WGS data. I think it's very important to document all my work and to make use of a reproducible workflow.
