Ana Silverio (she/her/ella) is a first generation Mexican-American marine ecologist studying coastal fisheries and extreme events. 
For her master's work, Ana is using long-term independent and dependent fisheries catch data from Texas Parks and Wildlife coupled with quantitative tools to study how extreme events like hurricanes, freezes and pandemics affect coastal sport fish populations along the Texas Gulf Coast. 

Prior to her position at UNH, she graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's in Biology with a concentration in Marine and Freshwater Science from the University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'Em Horns).
At UT Austin, Ana worked in a fisheries ecology lab where her research focused on age and growth studies of the red drum fishery off the Texas Gulf Coast.
While working with the red drum fishery, she developed otolith polishing protocols for future lab use and collaborated on growth modeling simulations using R Studio.
Most of Ana's interests lie in fisheries ecology, fisheries management and marine conservation.
She hopes to implement both quantitative tools and interdisciplinary strategies to address these ocean issues. 

Ana is passionate about outreach and promoting diversity and inclusion in marine science and is currently an active member of [Minorities in Shark Sciences](https://www.misselasmo.org/) an organization committed to encouraging women of color to pursue a career in shark sciences. With MISS, she helped on the scheduling committee for a virtual joint conference (POSea) for the marine science BIPOC community in 2021. Ana also enganges annually during [Latino Conservation Week](https://latinoconservationweek.com/), a collaboration with [Latino Outdoors](https://latinooutdoors.org/) and the [Hispanic Access Foundation](https://hispanicaccess.org/) to help emphasize the Latino role in conservation and improve the access the Latine community has to the outdoors. 

Outside of her scientific interests, Ana loves to go hiking, watching soccer (fútbol), live music, catching Pokémon or hanging out with her dog Willow!
