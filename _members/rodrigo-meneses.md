I'm a (Support) Bioinformatician in the BioIT group.

My main tasks involve group infrastructure, analysis support and consultancy. I also participate in research projects, where I focus on coding analysis pipelines. Recently, I've been working on finding minority variants from deep population sequencing, and using tehcnologies like Snakemake, Docker & Singularity.

I'm very interested in open science, code and data. I believe transparency leads to a more welcoming environment where scientific ideas can thrive.
