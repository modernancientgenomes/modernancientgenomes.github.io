# Modern and ancient Genomes

The Modern and Ancient Genomes group is found at the Technical University of Denmark on the outskirts of Copenhagen. We are broadly interested in methods applied to next-generation sequencing data, genotyping, allele frequencies and resolved haplotypes from either modern and ancient genomes as we as sedimentary DNA.

Pangenome graphs are a data structure to represent the known diversity of a species instead of just using a linear reference. Several computational tools are being developed actively to build such graphs and subsequently align DNA sequencing reads to them. In our group, we make extensive use of pangenome graphs in combination with Bayesian inference.

Ancient DNA (aDNA) is degraded DNA extracted from fossils, museum samples etc. aDNA offers an amazing opportunity to study ancient species but is plagued by fragmentation, short fragment length, chemical damage and contamination. Our group develops novel computational methods to deal with such idiosyncrasies.

Our group develops computational methods to analyze, store and use ancient allele frequencies. By studying genetic diversity in ancient populations, we can gain insights into the history and evolution of various species including humans. Our methods utilize advanced algorithms and statistical models to analyze large-scale datasets from modern and ancient sources.
