# <i class="fas join"></i>Join the Lab


All lab members must:
- Be decent human beings (we don’t work with jerks) 
- Have an interest in ecological systems **and** using quantitative tools (e.g., mathematical models, statistics, R)
- Want to change the world

Members of the lab are strongly committed to anti-racist practices, real diversity and inclusion efforts, and moving science beyond the ivory tower.

Our [lab handbook](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/blob/main/qmel-onboarding.md) is a living document and lays out expectations of lab members. 

## Commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity

One of my main commitments as a faculty member is promoting and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Please consider applying for a position in my lab if you are a first-generation college student, a student from a low-income background, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group, if you identify as a woman or as LGBTQ+, and/or if you have a disability.



## Undergraduate students

The lab often has openings for undergraduate students to contribute to projects or design a project for an undergraduate thesis/research experience. All students are paid or receive course credits. These projects are typically co-designed by the student, QMEL graduate students, and Professor Easton White. The undergraduate researcher role in the lab is more detailed in the [lab handbook](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab/lab-onboarding/blob/main/qmel-onboarding.md#being-a-successful-undergraduate-researcher).

We take applications at any time, but interns typically start in January, June, or August. There are UNH student specific opportunities, but we also have openings for non-UNH students and recent graduates.

The students most likely to be accepted for a position are those with a keen interest in developing quantitative skills in the context of marine systems.

After completing this [form](https://forms.gle/16fogrHEX7duePXw5), please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and goals and how you think these align with my research program.


## Graduate students

I am currently reviewing applications for Fall 2023. I will likely accept 1-2 additional graduate students to start in 2024. Applicants that will be the most competitive for a position will have experience (and willingness to learn more) with R, quantitative skills (e.g., mathematical modeling, statistics), and field work. A basic understanding of Spanish is a plus for some of the lab's projects. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and graduate school goals and how you think these align with my research program. I am also open to chatting about potential projects related to other areas of my research program. 

I can accept students through [UNH's Biological Sciences MS and PhD programs.](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences) There are specific programs in Integrative Biology (IB) and Marine Biology (MB). The priority deadline for Fall admission is January 15th each year. Although less common, I can also accept student through the [Oceanography](https://ceps.unh.edu/earth-sciences/academics) and [Integrated Applied Mathematics](https://ceps.unh.edu/integrated-applied-mathematics/academics) programs at UNH. If you are interested in working with me, I strongly recommended that you reach out to me before applying for graduate study. Graduate work is typically funded through a combination of fellowships, research positions, and teaching assistantships. Currently, the minimum yearly salary for a graduate student in QMEL is $29,518 per year (including summer). The salary is increases each year and is higher if you already have a MS degree. Health insurance and tuition are also covered by the lab/university. When we make an offer to a graduate student, there funding, and funding source, is described in detail in an offer letter. 

Depending on your specific interests, I might not be the best advisor for you at UNH. You may also want to reach out to [Dr. Melissa Aikens (plants, biology education)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/melissa-aikens), [Dr. Elizabeth Fairchild (fish, fisheries)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/elizabeth-fairchild), [Dr. Nathan Furey (fishes, sharks, animal movement)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/nathan-furey), [Dr. Elizabeth Harvey (phytoplankton, harmful algal blooms)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/elizabeth-harvey), [Dr. Brittany Jellison (marine invertebrates, intertidal systems, climate change)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/brittany-jellison), [Dr. Gregg Moore (marine plants, restoration)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/gregg-moore), and others in the [Biology Department](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/people) or within the [College of Life Science And Agriculture](https://colsa.unh.edu/). 


## Postdoctoral fellows

Conditional on funding, I will likely soon be looking for postdoctoral fellows to work on questions related to fisheries and disturbances, mathematical modeling of disturbances and socio-environmental systems, improving population monitoring and data collection, sustainable seafood, or synthesizing across socio-environmental fisheries. My background is in quantitative ecology with an emphasis on marine systems. However, my interests are broad and I am happy to discuss other project ideas further. I am also open to collaboratively working on proposals to help fund independent postdoctoral fellow positions through several different programs.
