# <i class="fas fa-sigma"></i>Research

Our research interest is to computational methods applied to ancient DNA, sedimentary DNA, ancient microbes, low-coverage DNA, haplotypes and allele frequencies. We mostly use pangenomic graphs, Bayesian inference. We also collaborate closely with groups that produce empirical data.

Here are some publications from the group along with software that is being actively supported by the lab.
