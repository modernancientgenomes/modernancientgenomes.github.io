# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

Our research interest is to find patterns in DNA sequencing data and to apply this knowledge to the genomic epidemiology of organisms causing infectious diseases. We are interested in the genomics of plasmids and other mobile genetic elements. Our group provides bioinformatics support for a medical microbiology department of an academic hospital. We design, write and maintain pipelines and databases for genomic or metagenomic analyses, carry out or advise on analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and provide bioinformatics education and consultation.
